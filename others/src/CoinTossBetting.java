     * You are writing a coin toss game which bets on Heads.
     *
     * For each round, you will get a fixed amount to bet. You start by betting 1. On a win (Heads), you double
     * the bet from last round; on a loss (Tail) you half the bet. The maximum amount to bet is all remaining and
     * minimum is 1.
     *
     * Implement CoinTossEndAmount which takes two parameters: 1. amount to bet with and 2. the results of coin toss
     * as a string, with H for Heads and T for Tails. Return the amount at end.
     *
     * For example, given an initial bet amount of 20, and tosses "HHH", you function should return 27 since
     * + 1 + 2 + 4 => 7 + 20 = 27
