# A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

# Given an input array where num[i] != num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

# The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

# You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -âˆž.

# For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

# Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
