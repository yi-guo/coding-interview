# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those
# horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# For example, given board =
#   ["ABCE",
#    "SFCS",
#    "ADEE"]

# word = "ABCCED" -> returns true,
# word = "SEE" -> returns true,
# word = "ABCB" -> returns false.

# The following presents a recursive solution to the problem. Do search for each cell on board.
