# Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1
# must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

# Input: num = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: (1, 2)


# Sort the array and conduct binary search; O(n log(n))
