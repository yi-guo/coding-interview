# You are given a year Y and two months A and B, where Y is an integer and A and B are strings.
# You are also given a day W indicating the day of the first day of year Y.
# Write a program to calculate the number of whole weeks inclusively from the first day of A to the last day of B,
# where a whole week is defined as a week that starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.

# You may assume that
#   - Y is a leap year if and only if Y is divisible by 4.
#   - A in ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August',
#           'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
#   - B in [A, 'December']
#   - W in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

# Your program should return an integer.

# For example, given Y = 2015, A = 'February', B = 'March', and W = 'Thursday', you program should return 8 since
# we have the week of 2/2, 2/9, 2/16, 2/23, 3/2, 3/7, 3/9, 3/16, 3/23.
